# Purpose
The file CWSTRAT-Components-Remove.BAS started out as a complete copy of CWSTRAT.BAS. Since then various subroutines have been moved out into their own files and removed from aforementioned in order to more easily visualize the software for the purpose of future modularization.

These files are not currently actively used by the application.
