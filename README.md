# We Use...
## Programming Languages
* Original: QuickBasic, PDS
* Current: QB64
## Tools
* Notepad++ - Our primary text editor.
* [Deark](http://entropymine.com/deark/) - Allows us to convert the original memory dump images to more current formats, e.g. PNG or JPEG.
* [Crimson Editor](http://www.crimsoneditor.com/) - Helpful when initially converting the files as the source code contained OEM characters which isn't shown correctly by most software and can wreak havoc in the code.
